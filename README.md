# Loan_Prediction
This repo consists of Prediction of a loan using Machine Learning
• Interpreted how different factors like Applicant Income, Credit History, Loan Term , Employment Status influence on sanction of a Loan
based on the data given in the dataset.
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas. Created a Heat Map Visualization
using seaborn which will effectively describe the correlation among the factors.
• Created Machine Learning Models using Decision Tree, Random Forests which are imported from scikit-learn.
• Improved the accuracy and Decreased the amount of Overfitting which is common in Decision Tree by using hyperparameters in tuning
with Cross Validation Sets.
• Achieved the maximum accuracy (about 84%) using the optimized Decision Tree followed by Random Forest and Decision Tree.
